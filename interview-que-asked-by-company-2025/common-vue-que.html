            Creation Phase :
                beforeCreate â†’ Instance is initialized, data/events not yet available.
                created â†’ Data, events, and reactivity are set up (but template not mounted).

            Mounting Phase :
                beforeMount â†’ Template is compiled, but not added to DOM yet.
                mounted â†’ Component is mounted to Real DOM (good for DOM-dependent work).

            Updating Phase :
                beforeUpdate â†’ Called before re-render when reactive data changes.
                updated â†’ DOM re-rendered with latest data.

            Unmounting/Destruction Phase :
                beforeUnmount / beforeDestroy â†’ Cleanup before component removal.
                unmounted / destroyed â†’ Component fully removed from DOM.

                <pre>
                    The <strong>Composition API</strong> in Vue.js is a way of writing components introduced in Vue 3.

                   â€¢ It gives you more flexibility, reusability, and better organization of logic compared to the traditional 
                     <strong>Options API</strong>(where we use data, methods, computed, etc. in separate blocks).

                   â€¢ With Composition API, you use functions like ref, reactive, computed, and watch inside a setup() function.
                     This keeps related logic grouped together and makes components easier to scale.

                   â€¢  The setup() (or &lt;script setup>) is the entry point for Composition API.

                    ** Spoken Language : ðŸ”¹ How to Speak in Interview
                    The Composition API in Vue 3 is a new way to write components using functions instead of the Options API structure. 
                    Instead of splitting logic into data, methods, and computed, we can organize related code together inside the setup() function. 
                    This makes the code cleaner, more reusable, and easier to maintain, especially in larger projects. For example, 
                    I can define a ref for a counter and increment it directly inside setup. Itâ€™s similar to React hooks in concept, providing better logic reuse and scalability."

                <h4 class="blue">what works of mixin ?</h4>
                <pre>Mixins let you reuse code across multiple components by sharing methods, data, or lifecycle hooks.</p>
                Follow-up explanation:
                    You can put common functionality (methods, computed properties, data) in a mixin.
                    When a component uses the mixin, it merges that code into itself.
                    Useful for avoiding repetition in large apps.
