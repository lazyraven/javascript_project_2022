                <pre>
            Creation Phase :
                beforeCreate ‚Üí Instance is initialized, data/events not yet available.
                created ‚Üí Data, events, and reactivity are set up (but template not mounted).

            Mounting Phase :
                beforeMount ‚Üí Template is compiled, but not added to DOM yet.
                mounted ‚Üí Component is mounted to Real DOM (good for DOM-dependent work).

            Updating Phase :
                beforeUpdate ‚Üí Called before re-render when reactive data changes.
                updated ‚Üí DOM re-rendered with latest data.

            Unmounting/Destruction Phase :
                beforeUnmount / beforeDestroy ‚Üí Cleanup before component removal.
                unmounted / destroyed ‚Üí Component fully removed from DOM.

                <pre>
                    The <strong>Composition API</strong> in Vue.js is a way of writing components introduced in Vue 3.

                   ‚Ä¢ It gives you more flexibility, reusability, and better organization of logic compared to the traditional 
                     <strong>Options API</strong>(where we use data, methods, computed, etc. in separate blocks).

                   ‚Ä¢ With Composition API, you use functions like ref, reactive, computed, and watch inside a setup() function.
                     This keeps related logic grouped together and makes components easier to scale.

                   ‚Ä¢  The setup() (or &lt;script setup>) is the entry point for Composition API.

                    ** Spoken Language : üîπ How to Speak in Interview
                    The Composition API in Vue 3 is a new way to write components using functions instead of the Options API structure. 
                    Instead of splitting logic into data, methods, and computed, we can organize related code together inside the setup() function. 
                    This makes the code cleaner, more reusable, and easier to maintain, especially in larger projects. For example, 
                    I can define a ref for a counter and increment it directly inside setup. It‚Äôs similar to React hooks in concept, providing better logic reuse and scalability."

                <pre>1. v-if vs v-show in Vue.js

                    ‚Ä¢ v-if
                            ‚Ä¢ Completely adds/removes the element from the DOM based on the condition.
                            ‚Ä¢ If the condition is false ‚Üí element is not in DOM at all.
                            ‚Ä¢ Has higher performance cost if toggled frequently because it destroys and recreates DOM nodes.
                    ‚Ä¢ v-show
                            ‚Ä¢ Keeps the element in the DOM always.
                            ‚Ä¢ Just toggles the CSS property display: none when the condition is false.
                            ‚Ä¢ Faster when toggling often, but the element always exists in DOM.</pre>

                <pre>2. Who removes the DOM element?

                    ‚Ä¢ ‚úÖ v-if removes/creates DOM nodes.
                    ‚Ä¢ ‚ùå v-show only hides/shows with CSS (does not remove).
               </pre>

               <pre>3. How to explain in an interview **(spoken version)

                    "v-if and v-show both handle conditional rendering in Vue, but they work differently.
                    v-if creates or removes elements from the DOM based on the condition, which is good when the condition changes rarely.
                    On the other hand, v-show keeps the element in the DOM and just toggles its visibility with CSS display: none, which is better when toggling frequently.
                    So, I choose v-if for conditions that change rarely and v-show for things like dropdowns or modals that toggle often."


                    ‚úÖ Summary in one line for interview:
                        Use v-if when rendering is expensive or condition is rare.
                        Use v-show when toggling visibility often but want to keep DOM intact.

                <h4 class="blue">what works of mixin ?</h4>
                <pre>Mixins let you reuse code across multiple components by sharing methods, data, or lifecycle hooks.</p>
                Follow-up explanation:
                    You can put common functionality (methods, computed properties, data) in a mixin.
                    When a component uses the mixin, it merges that code into itself.
                    Useful for avoiding repetition in large apps.
