| **React.js – Basics**   | What is React?                         | A JavaScript library for building UIs using a **component-based architecture** and **Virtual DOM**.                                 |
|                         | Props vs State?                        | **Props** → immutable, passed from parent. <br> **State** → mutable, managed inside component.                                      |
|                         | What is Virtual DOM?                   | A lightweight copy of the real DOM. React updates only the changed parts → faster UI rendering.                                     |
|                         | What are Hooks?                        | Functions like `useState`, `useEffect`, `useContext` that allow functional components to use state & lifecycle features.            |
|                         | Controlled vs Uncontrolled Components? | Controlled → React manages form data. <br> Uncontrolled → DOM manages data via refs.                                                |
|                         | Why are keys important in lists?       | Help React identify elements for efficient re-rendering. Must be unique.                                                            |
| **React.js – Advanced** | What is Context API?                   | A way to pass data through the component tree without props drilling.                                                               |

|                         | What is React.memo?                    | Higher-order component to prevent unnecessary re-renders.                                                                           |
|                         | useMemo vs useCallback?                | **useMemo** caches computed values. <br> **useCallback** caches function definitions.                                               |
|                         | Lifecycle methods in class components? | Mounting → `componentDidMount` <br> Updating → `componentDidUpdate` <br> Unmounting → `componentWillUnmount`.                       |
|                         | SSR vs CSR?                            | **SSR** → rendering on server (e.g., Next.js). <br> **CSR** → rendering in browser (default React).                                 |

|                         | Vue 2 vs Vue 3?                        | Vue 3 has **Composition API**, better performance (Proxy-based reactivity).                                                         |
|                         | Common directives?                     | `v-if`, `v-for`, `v-bind`, `v-model`.                                                                                               |
|                         | Computed vs Methods?                   | **Computed** → cached, runs only when dependency changes. <br> **Methods** → runs every time called.                                |
|                         | What are props?                        | Used to pass data from parent → child.                                                                                              |
|                         | One-way vs Two-way binding?            | One-way → data flows parent → child. <br> Two-way → `v-model` syncs both directions.                                                |
| **Vue.js – Advanced**   | What is Vuex?                          | State management library for Vue. Central store, mutations, actions.                                                                |
|                         | Mixins?                                | Code reusability tool. Share logic across components.                                                                               |
|                         | Composition API vs Options API?        | **Composition API** → functions for logic reuse. <br> **Options API** → object-based (data, methods, computed).                     |
|                         | Vue Router vs React Router?            | Both handle SPA navigation. Vue Router integrates more smoothly with Vue’s reactivity.                                              |
|                         | Reactivity in Vue 3?                   | Uses **Proxy** (instead of `Object.defineProperty`) for better performance & deep reactivity.                                       |
| **Node.js – Basics**    | What is Node.js?                       | JavaScript runtime built on **V8 engine**, used for server-side apps.                                                               |
|                         | Sync vs Async?                         | **Sync** → blocking. <br> **Async** → non-blocking, uses callbacks, promises, async/await.                                          |
|                         | What is Event Loop?                    | Mechanism that handles async operations by queueing callbacks in phases.                                                            |
|                         | Callbacks vs Promises vs Async/Await?  | **Callbacks** → function inside function. <br> **Promises** → chainable, cleaner. <br> **Async/Await** → syntax sugar for promises. |
|                         | npm & package.json?                    | **npm** → package manager. <br> **package.json** → project metadata & dependencies.                                                 |
|                         | Middleware in Express?                 | Functions that run before request handler (logging, auth, validation).                                                              |
| **Node.js – Advanced**  | Clustering?                            | Running multiple Node.js processes to use multi-core CPUs.                                                                          |
