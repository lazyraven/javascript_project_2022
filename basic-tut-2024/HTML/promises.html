                <li>Promises are javascript objects that represent an eventual completion or failure of an asynchronous operation.</li>
                <li>A promise has two possible outcomes: it will either be kept when the time comes or it won't.</li>
                <li>A promise is a returned object where you attach callbacks, instead of passing callbacks into a funtion.</li>
                 <pre class="language-javascript">
                    // callback function
                        const greet = (name) => {
                        console.log("Hi " + name);

                            if (name) resolve(name);
                            reject(false);
                        });
                        };
        
                    //start call
                        callMe().then((result) => greet(result));

                    <h4>Promise Definition 2:</h4>
                    <li>A Promise is an Object that will produce a single value sometime in the future. if the promise is successful, it'll produce a resolved value
                        but if something goes wrong then it will produce a reason why the promise failed.
                        Similar Said : It behaves very much similar to real life promises.
