        <h3>Event Loop : </h3>
        <h3 class="definition">Definition : </h3>
       <span>Even though setTimeout is called earlier, JS continues to the next line. The event loop
            and callback queue handle that delay asynchronously, without blocking the single thread.
        </span>
              <pre class="language-javascript">
            console.log("Start");
            setTimeout(() => {
            console.log("Delayed");
            }, 1000);

            console.log("End");

            <strong>Output:</strong>
            Start
            End
            Delayed  ‚Üê runs after 1 second, even though it's written earlier

        <div class="key-center">
            <p class="p-key-points">In the above example, the event loop allows the "Delayed" message to be printed after
                a 1-second delay, while the "Start" and "End" messages are printed immediately.</p>
            <p class="p-key-points">JavaScript is single-threaded, meaning it can only execute one piece of code at a
                time. The event loop manages asynchronous operations, allowing JavaScript to handle tasks like timers
                and network requests without blocking the main thread.</p>
            <p class="p-key-points">When an asynchronous operation completes, its callback is added to the callback queue.
                The event loop checks if the call stack is empty and then processes the callbacks in the queue.</p>
