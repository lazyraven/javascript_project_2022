for in loop >  ✔ Works, but not preferred for arrays.
        Why for...in is not ideal for arrays
        Iterates over indexes as strings
        Includes inherited properties
        Order is not guaranteed

Best practice

Use for...in → Objects
Use for...of → Arrays, strings, iterables

Important tip
Always guard with hasOwnProperty when needed:
    </pre>
  </div>
</body>
