const jsInterviewQuestions = [
  {
    questionId: 1,
    question: "What is JavaScript?",
    definition: `
JavaScript (JS) is a high-level, interpreted programming language mainly used to make web pages interactive, dynamic, and functional.
It runs in the browser as well as on servers (using Node.js).

👉 With JS, you can:
• Manipulate the DOM (change HTML/CSS dynamically).
• Handle user events (clicks, forms, etc.).
• Communicate with servers (API calls).
• Build full-stack applications.

In short: HTML gives structure, CSS gives style, and JavaScript gives behavior to web applications.
`
  },
  {
    questionId: 2,
    question: "var vs let vs const?",
    definition: `
In JavaScript:
• var → function-scoped and allows redeclaration.
• let → block-scoped, can be reassigned but not redeclared.
• const → block-scoped, cannot be reassigned.

Example:
var x = 10;  // function scope
let y = 20;  // block scope
const z = 30; // cannot reassign
`
  },
  {
    questionId: 3,
    question: "What is Scope?",
    definition: `
Scope defines the accessibility or visibility of variables, functions, and objects in different parts of the code.

Types of scope:
1. Global Scope – variables accessible everywhere.
2. Function Scope – variables declared inside a function are local to that function.
3. Block Scope – variables declared using let and const inside {} are not accessible outside.
`
  },
  {
    questionId: 4,
    question: "What is hoisting?",
    definition: `
Hoisting means variable and function declarations are moved to the top of their scope before code execution.

👉 Behavior:
var → hoisted with default value undefined.
let → hoisted but in the temporal dead zone (ReferenceError if accessed early).
const → hoisted but must be initialized at declaration.

Example:
console.log(a); // undefined
var a = 10;

console.log(b); // ReferenceError
let b = 20;

console.log(c); // ReferenceError
const c = 30;
`
  },
  {
    questionId: 5,
    question: "What is a function?",
    definition: `
A function is a reusable block of code designed to perform a specific task.

Functions help to:
• Organize code into smaller parts.
• Reuse logic without rewriting.
• Improve readability and maintainability.
`
  },
  {
    questionId: 6,
    question: "What is a closure? When is it useful? What is Lexical Scope?",
    definition: `
A closure is created when a function is defined inside another function and 
the inner function “remembers” variables from the outer function even after the outer function has returned.

Use cases:
1. Data Privacy – Hide variables.
2. Maintaining State – Keep track of previous values.
3. Callbacks & Event Handlers - Useful when passing functions around; they can access the outer scope variables they were created with.
4. Functional Programming – Currying, memoization, etc.

 ✨ In short: Closures are most useful when you need private variables, state persistence, or context preservation.

Example:
function counter() {
  let count = 0;
  return function() {
    count++;
    return count;
  };
}
const increment = counter();
console.log(increment()); // 1
console.log(increment()); // 2

Lexical Scope:
A function’s scope is determined by where it is defined in the code.
Inner functions can access outer function variables, not vice versa.
`
  },
  {
    questionId: 7,
    question: "What is IIFE (Immediately Invoked Function Expression)?",
    definition: `
An IIFE is a function that runs immediately after it is defined.

Example:
(function () {
  console.log("IIFE runs immediately!");
})();
`
  },
  {
    questionId: 8,
    question: "What are Prototypes?",
    definition: `
A prototype is an object from which other objects inherit properties and methods.

Prototype Chain:
If a property/method isn’t found on an object, JS looks up its prototype, then its prototype’s prototype, until it reaches null.

Example:
const obj = {};
console.log(obj.toString());
// Not in obj → found in Object.prototype → returns "[object Object]"
`
  },
  {
    questionId: 9,
    question: "How to deep clone an object?",
    definition: `
Deep cloning means creating a full copy of an object, including nested objects, 
so that changes in the copy don’t affect the original.

Modern Method:
const clone = structuredClone(obj);
 In Deep Learning : Go to this file console.log("file:///C:/workspace-nisha/01_github/02_Javascript/javascript_project_2022/basic-tut-2025/HTML/JavaScript");

`
  },
  {
    questionId: 10,
    question: "Difference between == and ===?",
    definition: `
== → compares values only (performs type conversion).
=== → compares both value and type (strict equality).

Example:
5 == "5"   // true
5 === "5"  // false
`
  },
  {
    questionId: 11,
    question: "Explain 'this' keyword in JS?",
    definition: `
The 'this' keyword refers to the object that is currently executing the function. 
Its value depends on how the function is called.

• Inside an object method → refers to the object.
• In a regular function → refers to global object (undefined in strict mode).
• Inside a class or constructor → refers to the instance.
• Arrow functions → do not have their own 'this'; they inherit from their lexical scope.
`
  },
  {
    questionId: 12,
    question: "What is call/apply/bind?",
    definition: `
• call → Immediately calls a function with a given 'this' and arguments individually.
• apply → Immediately calls a function with a given 'this' and arguments as an array.
• bind → Returns a new function with fixed 'this' and optional preset arguments.

Key difference:
call/apply = immediate execution.
bind = delayed (returns a new function).

⚡ Key difference: call/apply = immediate execution, bind = future execution.
`
  },
  {
    questionId: 13,
    question: "Explain classes and inheritance?",
    definition: `
A class is a blueprint for creating objects — it bundles properties and methods.

Inheritance allows one class (child) to use properties and methods of another class (parent) using 'extends'.

Key points:
• constructor() runs when a new object is created.
• super() calls parent constructor.
• Child classes can override methods.
• Classes are syntactic sugar over prototypes.
`
  },
  {
    questionId: 14,
    question: "What are Promises?",
    definition: `
A Promise represents the eventual completion (or failure) of an asynchronous operation.

States:
• Pending → initial.
• Fulfilled → resolved successfully.
• Rejected → failed.

Use .then() for success, .catch() for errors, .finally() for cleanup.
`
  },
  {
    questionId: 15,
    question: "Explain Async/Await?",
    definition: `
Async/Await (ES2017) are built on top of Promises.

• async → makes a function return a Promise.
• await → pauses execution until a Promise resolves/rejects.
• Helps avoid callback hell.

Promise = chaining
async/await = clean synchronous-like code.
`
  },
  {
    questionId: 16,
    question: "Explain Promises and async/await together?",
    definition: `
Execution Order (Event Loop):

1. Sync code runs first (Start, End).
2. Microtasks (Promises, await) run next.
3. Macrotasks (setTimeout) run last.

Example Output:
Start
Inside async
End
Promise then
After await
setTimeout

Synchronous → Microtasks → Macrotasks.

console.log("Check Other practice => file:///C:/workspace-nisha/01_github/02_Javascript/javascript_project_2022/basic-tut-2025/HTML/promiseAsyncAwait.html");
Spoken Answer : 
                    *"In JavaScript, execution follows the event loop model. First, synchronous code runs top to bottom. After
                     that, microtasks like Promise.then() and await callbacks run before macrotasks like setTimeout.

                    Promises are objects representing the result of an async operation, and we handle them with .then() or
                     .catch(). Async/await is built on top of Promises and makes async code look synchronous, improving readability.

                    For example, if I combine setTimeout, Promises, and async/await, the order is always: sync code first, 
                    then microtasks from Promises or await, and finally macrotasks like setTimeout. This is why understanding the 
                    event loop is crucial when debugging async behavior."*

`
  },
  {
    questionId: 17,
    question: "What are sequential promises?",
    definition: `
Sequential Promises:
Execute one after another — each waits for the previous to resolve.
• Useful when tasks are dependent on each other.   

Parallel Promises:
Run simultaneously — independent tasks that don’t wait for each other.
• Useful when tasks are independent.
`
  },
  {
    questionId: 18,
    question: "Explain the event loop?",
    definition: `
The event loop continuously checks the call stack and callback/microtask queues,
allowing asynchronous operations without blocking the main thread.

Cycle:
Call Stack → Microtask Queue (Promises) → Macrotask Queue (setTimeout, I/O)
`
  },
  {
    questionId: 19,
    question: "Explain Debounce & Throttle?",
    definition: `
Debounce:
Delays a function’s execution until after a specified time of no calls — great for search boxes.
mainly used to improve performance

Throttle:
Executes a function at fixed intervals — great for scroll or resize events.

Difference:
Debounce waits for silence.
Throttle runs on schedule.

Example:
Debounce: Typing → run after user stops.
Throttle: Scrolling → run every 200ms.
`
  },
  {
    questionId: 20,
    question: "Difference between process.nextTick and setImmediate (Node-specific)?",
    definition: `
process.nextTick → Runs immediately after the current function, before event loop continues.
setImmediate → Runs on the next event loop cycle (after I/O).

Use Cases:
• nextTick – urgent microtasks.
• setImmediate – defer heavy tasks post I/O.

Not Required for answer:
To use Node-specific features (process) inside the browser, which doesn’t have them.
`
  },
  {
    questionId: 21,
    question: "How many things do you know about JS?",
    definition: `
JavaScript is a high-level, versatile language for building dynamic web applications.\nI have a strong grasp of its fundamentals, including ES6 features, async programming, and frameworks like React, Angular, Vue, and Node.js for full-stack development.
`
  },
  { 
        questionId: 22, 
        question: "What is ES6?", 
        definition : `
ES6 is the 2015 update to JavaScript that introduced modern features\n like let, const, arrow functions, classes, modules, and promises — making code cleaner, easier, and more efficient.
` 
  },
  {
    questionId: 23,
    question: "What is the difference between Real DOM and Virtual DOM?",
    definition: `
Real DOM:
    • Represents the actual structure of the webpage in the browser.
    • When a change occurs, the entire page or large sections re-render — making it slower.

Virtual DOM:
    \n• A lightweight copy of the Real DOM used by frameworks like React.
    \n• It updates only the modified parts by comparing (diffing) the Virtual DOM with the Real DOM — making it faster and more efficient.

In Short:
    • Real DOM: Updates the whole UI directly — slower.
    • Virtual DOM: Updates only what’s changed — faster and smoother.
`
  },
{
    questionId: 24,
    question: "What are Web Selectors?",
    definition: `
A web selector (also called as CSS selector) is a pattern used in web development to sleect and target specific HTML elements on a webpage,
so you can apply style (using css) or manipulate them (using javascript). 
In short- selectors tell the browser “which element(s) this rule applies to.

1. The Universal Selector (*) selects all elements on a webpage.  
   Example:
   * {
     margin: 0;
     padding: 0;
   }

2. The Element Selector (div, p, h1, etc.) targets all elements of a specific type.  
   Example:
   p {
     color: blue;
   }

3. The Class Selector (.classname) targets elements with a specific class attribute.  
   Example:
   .highlight {
     background-color: yellow;
   }

4. The ID Selector (#idname) targets a unique element with a specific ID.  
   Example:
   #header {
     font-size: 20px;
   }

5. The Attribute Selector ([attr=value]) selects elements with a particular attribute or value.  
   Example:
   input[type="text"] {
     border: 1px solid gray;
   }

6. The Descendant Selector (parent child) targets elements nested inside another element.  
   Example:
   div p {
     color: green;
   }

7. The Pseudo-class Selector (:hover, :nth-child(), etc.) targets elements based on their state or position.  
   Example:
   a:hover {
     color: red;
   }

8. The Pseudo-element Selector (::before, ::after) styles specific parts of an element.  
   Example:
   p::first-letter {
     font-size: 24px;
   }

9. In JavaScript, selectors are also used to access elements.  
   Example:
   document.querySelector(".btn");      // Selects the first element with class "btn"
   document.querySelectorAll("p");      // Selects all <p> elements
   document.getElementById("header");   // Selects the element with ID "header"
