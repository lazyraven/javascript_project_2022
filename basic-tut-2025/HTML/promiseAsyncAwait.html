            <div>
                <pre>Expected Answer
                Step-by-step reasoning:

                1. Synchronous code runs first
                    â€¢ "Start" is logged.
                    â€¢ Inside the Promise constructor executes immediately â†’ logs "Inside Promise".
                    â€¢ "End" logs next (still synchronous).

                2. Microtasks (Promises/await) run after sync code
                    â€¢ The then() callback is queued in the microtask queue.
                    â€¢ The async function is called â†’ logs "Inside async function".
                    â€¢ The await pauses execution until the Promise resolves.

                3. Then microtasks are executed
                    â€¢ First, .then() runs â†’ logs "Resolved Value".
                    â€¢ Then, the paused async function continues â†’ logs "Await result: Resolved Value".

                    ðŸ‘‰ This type of question tests your understanding of:

                        â€¢ Event loop
                        â€¢ Synchronous vs asynchronous execution
                        â€¢ Microtask queue (Promises, async/await) vs macrotask queue (setTimeout)

                        output :
                        Start
                        Inside Promise
                        Inside async function
                        End
                        Resolved Value
                        Await result: Resolved Value
