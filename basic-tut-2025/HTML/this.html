            <div>
                <pre>Definition : In JavaScript, the this keyword is a special reference that points to the object that is currently executing the function. Its value depends on how the function is called, not where it is defined.
                        •  this depends on how a function is called.
                        • Arrow functions do not bind their own this.

                 <strong>1. Inside an Object Method :</strong> When this is used inside an object method, it refers to that object.
                
                <strong>2. In a Regular Function (Global Scope) :</strong> If you use this in a normal function (not inside an object), it depends:
                     • In strict mode → this is undefined.
                     • In non-strict mode → this refers to the global object (window in browsers, global in Node.js).

                 <strong>3. Inside a Constructor Function : </strong> When using a constructor (with new), this refers to the newly created object.

                 <strong>4. In a Class :</strong> In classes, this works like in constructor functions — it refers to the instance of the class.

                 <strong>5. Arrow Functions :</strong> Arrow functions don’t have their own this. They inherit this from the surrounding scope.
                Arrow functions are often used when you want to preserve the this value from the outer scope.
