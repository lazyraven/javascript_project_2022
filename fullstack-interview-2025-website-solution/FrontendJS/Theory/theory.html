        <h3 class="blue">Question 1: var vs let vs const </h3>
    <pre>Definition : In JavaScript, var is function-scoped and allows redeclaration,
                            while let is block-scoped and can only be reassigned, not redeclared.
                            const is also block-scoped but values canâ€™t be reassigned.</pre>
    </div>

        <h3 class="blue">Question 2: What is hoisting? </h3>
        <p>Definition : Hoisting in JavaScript means variable and function declarations are moved to the top of their scope before code execution.</p>
        <pre>ðŸ‘‰ Explanation:
                    var â†’ hoisted with default value undefined.
        
                    let â†’ hoisted but in temporal dead zone, gives ReferenceError.
        
                    const â†’ same as let, but must be initialized at declaration.
                </pre>
        <pre>
            example covering var, let, and const hoisting in one go:
        <code>
            // var example
            console.log(a); // undefined
            var a = 10;

            // let example
            console.log(b); // ReferenceError
            let b = 20;

            // const example
            console.log(c); // ReferenceError
            const c = 30;
        </code>
        </pre>

    </div>

      <div>
        <h3 class="blue">Question 3: What is closure? </h3>
        <pre>Definition : In JavaScript, a closure is created when a function is defined inside another function and 
                    the inner function "closes over" (remembers) the variables of the outer function.
                    It allows the inner function to access and manipulate those outer variables even after the outer function has returned.</pre>
        <h3 class="blue">Question 3.1: When is it(closure) useful? </h3>
                    <pre>
                      1. Data Privacy / Encapsulation => You can hide variables from the outside world and expose only whatâ€™s necessary.
                      2. Maintaining State => Closures let functions "remember" past values even after their outer function has executed.
                      3. Callbacks & Event Handlers => Useful when passing functions around; they can access the outer scope variables they were created with.
                      4. Functional Programming => Helpful in currying, memoization, and creating higher-order functions.

                      âœ¨ In short: Closures are most useful when you need private variables, state persistence, or context preservation.
                      
                      Example :
                      function counter() {
                            let count = 0;
                            return function () {
                                count++;
                                return count;
                            };
                        }
                        const increment = counter();
                        console.log(increment()); // 1
                        console.log(increment()); // 2
