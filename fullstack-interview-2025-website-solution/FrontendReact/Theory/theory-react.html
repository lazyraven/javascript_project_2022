    <p>PROMPT EXAMPLE :Functional vs class components in react js , how to reply to interviewer for this question ?
        prepare a short 2‚Äì3 line version (quick reply) in case the interviewer asks this as a rapid-fire question?
        prepare a code snippet comparison (class vs functional) that you can mention if the interviewer asks for an
        example?

            <h4 class="blue">What is (React) ‚Äì JSX(JavaScript XML) ?</h4>
            <pre>Definition :  In-short : JSX ‚Üí whenever writing UI structure.

                ‚Ä¢ A syntax extension for JavaScript that lets you write HTML-like code inside JavaScript.
                ‚Ä¢ JSX is not required, but it makes UI easier to write and read.
                ‚Ä¢ Under the hood, JSX compiles into React.createElement(...).

                üëâ Where to use it:
                ‚Ä¢ Whenever you want to define UI structure in React.

                Use JSX in all React components unless you want to work only with raw JavaScript.
            </pre>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h4 class="blue">What is Components ?</h4>
            <pre> Definition :  In-short :JSX ‚Üí To break UI into small, reusable pieces.

                ‚Ä¢ Reusable building blocks of a React app.
                ‚Ä¢ Two types:
                    ‚Ä¢ Functional components (modern standard, simpler)
                    ‚Ä¢ Class components (older, rarely needed now).

                üëâ Where to use it:
                ‚Ä¢ Every piece of UI should ideally be a component.
                ‚Ä¢ Helps you split big UI into small, reusable, independent pieces.

                üí° Use components for modularity, reusability, and maintainability.
            </pre>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h4 class="blue">What is Props ?</h4>
            <pre>Definition :  In-short : To pass data into components (read-only, like parameters).

                ‚Ä¢ Short for properties.
                ‚Ä¢ Data passed from parent to child (read-only).
                ‚Ä¢ Think of them like function parameters.

                üëâ Where to use it:
                ‚Ä¢ When you want to customize a component with external data.
            </pre>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h4 class="blue">What is State ?</h4>
            <pre>Definition :  In-short : To manage data inside a component (can change, triggers re-render).

                ‚Ä¢ A built-in object that stores data inside a component.
                ‚Ä¢ Unlike props, state is managed within the component and can change over time.
                ‚Ä¢ When state changes ‚Üí React re-renders the UI.
               
                üëâ Where to use it:
                ‚Ä¢ For data that changes within the component (user input, API results, toggle, counters, etc.).
            </pre>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h4 class="blue">What is Class Component ?</h4>
            <pre>Definition :  In-short : Class components are ES6 classes that extend React.Component using this.state and lifecycle methods.

                ES6 class
                ‚Ä¢ this.state and setState()
                ‚Ä¢ Methods like componentDidMount, componentDidUpdate
                ‚Ä¢ Must handle this binding.
                ‚Ä¢ Slightly heavier, older approach
                </pre>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h4 class="blue">What is Functional Component ?</h4>
            <pre>Definition :  In-short : While functional components are plain functions that use hooks like useState and useEffect.
                 Functional components are now preferred because they‚Äôre simpler, cleaner, and the modern React standard.

                 Plain JS function
                ‚Ä¢ useState, useReducer 
                ‚Ä¢ Hooks like useEffect. 
                ‚Ä¢ No this, simpler
                ‚Ä¢ Lighter, often preferred, Cleaner, concise
               
               * Class components are mainly for older React codebases, 
                while functional components with hooks are the modern standard for new projects because they‚Äôre simpler and more efficient.
            </pre>

        <li>
            <h4 class="blue">What is ( React) ‚Äì useEffect, useState, lifecycle. ? Example in functional and class component jsx flickering</h4>
            <pre>Definition :  In React, useState lets us add and manage state in functional components. 
                useEffect is used to handle side effects such as data fetching, subscriptions, or DOM updates, and it runs after render.

                It can be configured to run once (like componentDidMount), on every render (componentDidUpdate), or for cleanup (componentWillUnmount). 
                In class components, these behaviors are split across lifecycle methods, but

                With hooks, we manage them inside a single functional component in a cleaner, more readable way.
               
            </pre>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h4 class="blue">How does React‚Äôs virtual DOM work ?</h4>
            <pre>Definition :  In React‚Äôs Virtual DOM is a lightweight copy of the real DOM. When the state changes, React updates the Virtual DOM first, 
                compares it with the previous version (diffing), and then updates only the changed parts in the real DOM for efficiency.

               üëâ Quick reply: ‚ÄúReact uses a Virtual DOM to track changes. 
               It compares new and old states (diffing) and updates only the necessary parts in the real DOM for faster performance.‚Äù
            </pre>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h4 class="blue">What is  Routing - React Router ?</h4>
            <pre>Definition :  React Router enables navigation in a React app without reloading the page. 
                It maps URLs to components, making single-page apps feel like multi-page apps.

                * React Router lets you navigate between views in a React app without refreshing the page.
            </pre>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h4 class="blue">What is SPA (Single Page Application) vs MPA (Multi Page Application) ?</h4>
            <pre>Definition :  SPA (Single Page Application) loads one HTML file and updates content dynamically without full reloads, giving a smoother, faster experience. 
                MPA (Multi Page Application) loads a new HTML page for every request, which is heavier but better for SEO and complex apps.‚Äù

                * One-liner fallback:
                ‚ÄúSPA updates content dynamically on one page, while MPA reloads new pages for each request.‚Äù

            üëâ Quick memory hook:

                SPA = Speedy & smooth (but SEO issues).
                MPA = SEO-friendly (but slower UX).
            </pre>

            <pre>
                SPA (Single Page Application)

                ‚úÖ Pros:

                 ‚Ä¢ Faster, smoother user experience (no full page reloads)
                 ‚Ä¢ Efficient data fetching (API-driven)
                 ‚Ä¢ Great for dynamic, interactive apps (e.g., Gmail, Twitter)

                ‚ùå Cons:

                 ‚Ä¢ SEO challenges (requires SSR or pre-rendering)
                 ‚Ä¢ Larger initial load time
                 ‚Ä¢ Can be complex for very large apps

                 MPA (Multi Page Application)

                ‚úÖ Pros:

                 ‚Ä¢ Better SEO by default (separate pages with metadata)
                 ‚Ä¢ Easier to manage very large, content-heavy apps
                 ‚Ä¢ Built-in security (less exposed frontend code)

                ‚ùå Cons:

                 ‚Ä¢ Slower (full reload on every navigation)
                 ‚Ä¢ Heavier server load
                 ‚Ä¢ More repetitive frontend code

            <h4 class="blue">What is state management Redux ?</h4>
            <pre>Definition :  Redux is a state management library for JavaScript apps. 
                 It uses a single centralized store where state is managed through actions and reducers, making data flow predictable and easier to debug.
            </pre>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h4 class="blue">What is Context API vs Redux ?</h4>
            <pre>Definition :  Context API is built into React for passing state through the component tree, ideal for simple or medium state needs.
                 Redux is a standalone library with a single global store, better for large, complex apps needing predictable state and advanced debugging.
                 
                 One-liner fallback:
                ‚ÄúContext API is for simple state sharing in React, Redux is for complex global state with predictable updates.‚Äù
