            <h4 class="blue">What is Node basics (fs, path, modules) ?</h4>
            <pre>Definition :  INode.js basics include fs for file operations, path for handling file paths, and modules for code organization and reuse. 
                They allow us to read/write files, resolve paths safely, and export/import functionality across files.

            <h4 class="blue">What is CommonJS vs ES modules in node js ?</h4>
            <pre>Definition :  CommonJS (require/module.exports) is Node’s original module system, synchronous and server-focused. 
                ES Modules (import/export) are modern, support static analysis, and work natively in Node with .mjs or "type": "module" in package.json.
            </pre>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h4 class="blue">What is Express basics, middleware ?</h4>
            <pre>Definition :  Express is a minimal Node.js web framework for building APIs and web apps. 
            Middleware are functions that process requests/responses, like logging, authentication, or parsing data, before reaching the route handler. 

            *1-liner explanation:
            Express is a Node.js web framework; middleware are functions that run during request/response processing.
            app.use((req, res, next) => { console.log(req.url); next(); });
        </pre>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h4 class="blue">What is Types of middleware ?</h4>
            <pre>Definition :  Express middleware can be application-level (used across the app), router-level (used for specific routes), 
                built-in (like express.json()), or error-handling (handles errors passed via next(err)).
        </pre>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h4 class="blue">What is REST APIs with Express ?</h4>
            <pre>Definition : REST APIs in Express let you handle HTTP requests (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) to perform CRUD operations.
                 Express routes map URLs to functions that process data and return responses in JSON or other formats.
            </pre>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h4 class="blue">What is REST vs GraphQL ?</h4>
            <pre>Definition : REST APIs expose multiple endpoints and return fixed data structures, 
                while GraphQL uses a single endpoint and lets clients request exactly the data they need. 
                GraphQL reduces over-fetching and under-fetching compared to REST.
OR 
                REST APIs use multiple endpoints, each returning fixed data, so you often over-fetch or under-fetch. 
                GraphQL uses a single endpoint and lets clients request exactly the data they need. 
                For example, in REST you’d use GET /users to fetch all users, while in GraphQL you’d write a query like { user(id: "1") { id, name } }.

        <li>
            <h4 class="blue">What is MongoDB + Mongoose ?</h4>
            <pre>Definition : MongoDB is a NoSQL database for storing JSON-like documents. 
                 Mongoose is an ODM (Object Data Modeling) library for Node.js that helps define schemas and interact with MongoDB in an organized way.

                 * MongoDB is a NoSQL database, and Mongoose is a Node.js library to define schemas and interact with it easily.

                 OR

                 MongoDB is a NoSQL database that stores data as JSON-like documents, making it flexible and scalable.
                 Mongoose is a Node.js library that adds structure by defining schemas, validation, and easy methods to create, read, update, and delete data.
