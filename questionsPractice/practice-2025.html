        <h3>higher-order function (HOF)</h3>
        A higher-order function either accepts functions as arguments or returns a function, making them powerful for abstraction and reusability.  

        <pre> Common built-in higher-order functions in JS:
            map()
            filter()
            reduce()
            forEach()
            sort()

     </pre>

     <h3>Virtual dom & react dom ?</h3>
     <p>Real DOM updates the whole UI directly, but Virtual DOM updates only the changed parts first in memory and then reflects them efficiently.</p>
    OR 
    <p>The Real DOM updates directly in the browser and is slower, 
        while the Virtual DOM is a lightweight in-memory representation that makes updates faster by batching changes</p>
    </div>

    <h4>VUE QUESTIONS </h4>
    <pre>
            Creation Phase

            beforeCreate → Instance is initialized, data/events not yet available.

            created → Data, events, and reactivity are set up (but template not mounted).

            Mounting Phase

            beforeMount → Template is compiled, but not added to DOM yet.

            mounted → Component is mounted to Real DOM (good for DOM-dependent work).

            Updating Phase

            beforeUpdate → Called before re-render when reactive data changes.

            updated → DOM re-rendered with latest data.

            Unmounting/Destruction Phase

            beforeUnmount / beforeDestroy → Cleanup before component removal.

            unmounted / destroyed → Component fully removed from DOM.

       <h3>“Authentication |Authorization </h3>
       👉 One-liner:
“Authentication checks who you are, and authorization checks what you’re allowed to do.”

Follow-up explanation:

Authentication → Verifying identity (like login with username/password, OTP, or social login).

Authorization → Controlling access to resources based on permissions or roles (like admin vs user access).

            *********

            :

👉 “ref creates a reactive single value, while reactivity (reactive) makes an entire object reactive.”

You can also add a tiny clarification:

ref → For primitives or single values.

reactive → For objects or arrays.
